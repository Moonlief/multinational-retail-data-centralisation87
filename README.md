## Project Title: Multinational Retail Data Centralisation


## A description of the project: 



This project is for a multinational corporation engaged in the sale of diverse products across the global market. Currently, the sales data is dispersed across numerous data sources, posing accessibility and analytical challenges for the existing team. In order to transition towards a more data-focused approach, the organization aims to centralize its sales data. The primary objective is to develop a system for storing the company's current data in a database, facilitating centralized access and establishing a singular point of reference for sales data. Subsequently, this database will be utilized to extract real-time business metrics.



Throughout the second milestone, my primary focus entailed the extraction of data from diverse sources such as JSON, PDF, and API. Simultaneously, I endeavored to establish an engine for my local database and embraced the implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) methodology to facilitate the streamlining of tasks.



The subsequent milestone is centered on establishing the star schema using SQL (Postgres and PGADMIN).



The ultimate milestone involves executing data queries.



Over the course of these milestones, I acquired essential knowledge regarding the accurate loading of data into a dataframe from various sources, as well as the capability to reload data following errors in SQL.



Furthermore, I gained insights into the interdependence of tables, which may pose challenges during data reloading but are doable.



I also developed an understanding of the criticality of data cleaning and the deliberation of whether to undertake it in Python or SQL.



Despite encountering challenges with Object-Oriented Programming, I acknowledge its value, particularly its potential for recalling processes for loading and cleaning diverse data sources.
